                                <p>This is the first part of the level and serves as an introduction to the game mechanics.</p>
                                <p>The first jumps allow the player to get accustomed to the jumping mechanic, while the first enemies provide an easy challenge that exposes the player to melee and ranged combat.</p>
                                <p>The player also learns to change form to better progress through the level by the introduction of ledges too high for the human form to pass through.</p>
                                <p>At the end of the stage the player faces the first real challenge by being exposed the several enemies at once, including a hybrid enemy, the strongest non-boss foe in the beginning of the game.</p>

                                <p>By completing the first stage, the player arrives at the city.</p>
                                <p>This part of the level is more focused on exploration, as the player has to make use of the previously learned skills to traverse through the several buildings, looking for a way out of the city.</p>
                                <p>The player progresses through this part by destroying three generators, that can be overloaded by shooting at them. When the three generators are destroyed a portal is opened that allows the protagonist to continue his journey.</p>
                                <p>The first generator can be found on the ground on the right side of the map, guarded by three enemies.</p>
                                <p>The second generator is found on the right, on top of a building. To reach it the player has to climb more complicated routes, and make use of more complicated mechanics such as dashing while jumping.</p>
                                <p>To reach the third generator the player has to first solve a small puzzle where he activates chimneys by dragging boxes on top of activators. When all chimneys are active, the main chimneys blow steam, which launches the player into the air, while the small ones expel flames that damage the player. Then he to fight more enemies and pass more climbing challenges.</p>
